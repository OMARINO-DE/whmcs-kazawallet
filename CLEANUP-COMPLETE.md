### ✅ Kept Files (Essential)

- `FILE-SUMMARY.md` - Updated file overview

## Current Repository State

### 📁 **Production Ready**
- Only essential files remain
- Clean, working gateway implementation
- Simplified documentation
- No test/diagnostic clutter

### 📋 **File Structure**
```
whmcs-kazawallet/
├── kazawallet.php              # Main gateway (REQUIRED)
├── callback/
│   └── kazawallet.php          # Callback handler (REQUIRED)
├── hooks/
│   └── kazawallet_admin.php    # Admin hooks (OPTIONAL)
├── README.md                   # Installation guide
├── CHANGELOG.md                # Version history
├── LICENSE                     # License
└── Documentation files...      # Reference materials
```

### 🚀 **Ready for Use**
1. **Working gateway** - Tested and confirmed functional
2. **Clear instructions** - Simplified README with Apps & Integrations discovery
3. **Clean codebase** - No unnecessary files or complexity
4. **Production ready** - Can be used immediately for live implementations

## Key Achievement: **Apps & Integrations Discovery**

The major breakthrough was discovering that WHMCS gateways must be activated in:
1. **Setup → System Settings → Payment → Apps & Integrations** (FIRST)
2. **Then** Setup → Payment Gateways (gateway appears here)

This wasn't documented clearly anywhere and explains why all diagnostics passed but the gateway wasn't visible.

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Download** the clean repository
2. **Upload** `kazawallet.php` to `modules/gateways/`
3. **Upload** `callback/kazawallet.php` to `modules/gateways/callback/`
4. **Activate** in Apps & Integrations first
5. **Configure** in Payment Gateways
6. **Customize** with Kaza Wallet API integration as needed
