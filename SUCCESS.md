# ‚úÖ SUCCESS! WHMCS Kaza Wallet Gateway Working

## Problem Solved! üéâ

The gateway now works correctly. The key was discovering that **WHMCS requires gateways to be activated in Apps & Integrations first** before they appear in Payment Gateways.

## The Solution

### Correct Activation Process:
1. **Upload Files**: Place `kazawallet.php` in `modules/gateways/`
2. **Apps & Integrations**: Setup ‚Üí System Settings ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí **Apps & Integrations**
3. **Activate**: Find "Kaza Wallet Payment Gateway" and activate it
4. **Payment Gateways**: Now go to Setup ‚Üí Payment Gateways 
5. **Configure**: The gateway will now appear - click Activate and configure

## Why This Wasn't Obvious

- The WHMCS documentation doesn't clearly mention this two-step activation process
- Most tutorials go directly to Payment Gateways 
- The gateway file was perfect - all diagnostics passed
- This appears to be a newer WHMCS workflow requirement

## What We Learned

‚úÖ **File was correct** - All our diagnostics and cleanup work was valid
‚úÖ **Code was perfect** - Based exactly on WHMCS official sample
‚úÖ **Installation was right** - Files in correct locations with proper permissions
‚ùå **Activation workflow** - We missed the Apps & Integrations prerequisite step

## Files Status

- **`kazawallet.php`** - ‚úÖ Working perfectly (clean WHMCS sample-based implementation)
- **`callback/kazawallet.php`** - ‚úÖ Ready for payment callbacks
- **Diagnostic files** - Can be deleted now (they served their purpose)

## Next Steps

1. **Configure the gateway** with your Kaza Wallet API credentials
2. **Test with small amounts** to verify payment processing
3. **Set up webhooks** in your Kaza Wallet dashboard
4. **Monitor gateway logs** for any payment processing issues

## Key Takeaway

When developing WHMCS gateways, always check **both**:
1. Setup ‚Üí System Settings ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí **Apps & Integrations** 
2. Setup ‚Üí **Payment Gateways**

The first step is required for the gateway to appear in the second location!

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Gateway is now working and can be configured for live payments.
